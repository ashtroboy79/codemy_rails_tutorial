# README

This is the end result of following the learn [Ruby on Rails - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmyvWz5TUWg&t=13477s) by John Elder of [CODEMY.COM](https://codemy.com/), as hosted on Youtube by [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). 
The tutorial uses Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, Devise and sqlite3.

Currrently this has no tests and I hope to write some for this soon
